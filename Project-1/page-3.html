        What is Drawlloween you ask?</p>
        <p>
          Back in 2015, Instagrammer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mabgraves/" class="link1">Mab Graves</a>
          started doing a daily drawing challenge for the month of October.
          She wasn't necessarily the first one to do something like this,
          but helped popularize this movement. Starting with a list of prompts
          at the beginning of the month, everyone on Instagram has a chance to
          follow along and post their own drawings. The hashtag
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mabsdrawlloweenclub/" class="link1">#mabsdrawlloweenclub</a>
          is included in each photo's caption and everyone can see eachothers work.
          It's a lot of fun!
        </p>

      <p>
        This year I decided to join in on the fun. This webpage is dedicated to
        sharing all of these drawings in one place for the world to see.
        I hope you enjoy!
