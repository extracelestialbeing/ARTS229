              Crafting makes me happy. So it made sense for me to name this blog Craft Happy. Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed making things. I come from a family of makers, so growing up it was a new project every week. From gifts, to home decor, and everything in between, if I can make it, I probably will.

              There are a lot of great reasons to make things. First of all, why buy it when you could make something one of a kind? It usually costs way less, and there will never be anything exactly like it. Plus, handmade gifts are way better.

              Another reason I like to make things rather than buy them, is it's more sustainable. Not only is it a nice jab at capitalism, but it also reduces waste. Handmade items are timeless and therefore won't go out of style next season. Overall, a win win!
